### Responsible Use of Data: Socioenvironmental Considerations I 

**Question 1**

Which of the following best describes the primary purpose of The REFLECT Framework

- To maximize statistical power when analyzing large neuroimaging datasets
- To standardize race and ethnicity coding across all ABCD publications
- To provide a checklist for socio-demographic variables to control for when using ABCD data
- To provide a systematic approach to conduct responsible research when working with large-scale neuroimaging datasets that include diverse populations and demographic variables.

**Question 2**

True or False? The ABCD Study recruited over 11,800 children aged 9-10 at baseline from 21 sites across the United States. The study used school-based recruitment to approximate the demographic diversity of the U.S. population. This ensures that the sample is representative for every analysis.

- True
- False

False

**Question 3**

Which practice does the lecture caution AGAINST when aiming to promote transparency and reproducibility in ABCD analyses?

- Documenting all coding decisions and analytical choices
- Clearly articulating exclusions, missing data, and study limitations
- Following recommended practices for reproducible research and providing sufficient detail for replication
- Including demographic variables in models because they were used in previously published journal articles, without providing a clear theoretical or methodological rationale

**Question 4**

According to the lecture, what is the recommendation for conceptualizing race/ethnicity when formulating an analytic plan and reporting results? Select all that apply

- Define race and ethnicity as socially constructed categories shaped by historical and structural processes, not as biological variables.
- Always include race/ethnicity as a covariate in statistical models to control for unmeasured social factors
- Prioritize direct measurement of environmental and social determinants when examining differences associated with race and ethnicity, rather than relying on demographic proxies.
- Be explicit that observed associations between race/ethnicity and health outcomes reflect differential environmental exposures, social experiences, and access to resources shaped by structural factors, not innate biological differences.

**Question 5**

Which example best reflects responsible and precise language recommended in the lecture?

- After controlling for race, results remained significant.
- Vulnerable populations show reduced brain volume.
- Differences in brain outcomes were associated with social and environmental factors that vary by demographic groups
- Racial differences in brain development were observed.

**Question 6**

According to the lecture, what is a key strength of using secondary quantitative data from the ABCD Study?

- It provides large, longitudinal samples with extensive measures across social, environmental, and developmental domains
- It allows researchers to control all aspects of data collection
- It eliminates the need for theoretical frameworks

**Question 7**

What is a major limitation of relying solely on secondary quantitative analyses of large datasets like ABCD?

- The large sample size limits statistical power
- Availability of hundreds of variables make selection of variables for the model easier and prevents the risk of “fishing expeditions” to detect effect sizes
- The context of not engaging with participants first-hand that can be helpful for interpreting findings
- Important contextual and lived-experience information may be missing, limiting interpretation of data, especially for underrepresented populations in big datasets

True

**Question 9**

According to the lecture, what is the role of community-engaged research when working with ABCD secondary data?

- To reduce analytic complexity by streamlining variable selection and avoiding additional interpretive or contextual considerations.
- To use the expertise of community partners to inform multiple stages of the research process, including research design, variable selection from the ABCD dataset, recruitment for qualitative components, contextualization and interpretation of findings, and strengthening real-world relevance
- To replace academic theory with community opinion
- To recruit participants directly into the ABCD Study and manage primary data collection for the main longitudinal cohort.

**Question 10**

Which of the following statements accurately describe mixed-methods designs used with secondary data, as presented in the lecture? Select all that apply

- In a convergent design, secondary quantitative data and qualitative data are collected concurrently and weighted equally, with findings interpreted together to reach conclusions.
- In a convergent design, qualitative data are primarily used to validate quantitative findings rather than being equally weighted.
- In an exploratory sequential design, quantitative analyses are conducted first to identify unexpected patterns that are later explored qualitatively.
- In an exploratory sequential design, qualitative findings are used to inform decisions about quantitative data collection, analysis, and interpretation.
- In an explanatory sequential design, secondary quantitative data drive the initial findings, which then inform qualitative data collection and interpretation.
